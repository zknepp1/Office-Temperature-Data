# Office-Temperature-Data
The purpose of this analysis is to collect temperature data within the office to show how hot my work office gets on a daily basis. SOS!!!

Previous research shows that optimal working temperatures for workers in the office are between 70ºF and 72ºF. *"Any temperature above 73ºF decreases your productivity."* - https://chrisbailey.com/temperature-productivity/

Below is that data collected from my work office. T1, T2, T3, T4 are time variables and represent the time the temperature was recorded. T1 and T2 are temperature recorded in the morning. T3 and T4 are temperatures recorded in the afternoon. All temperatures are recorded in Fahrenheit. The weather variable shows whether the sun was beaming into the office in the afternoon (s) or if it was cloudy (c). It is found that the weather was the biggest determination of whether the temperature was going to reach above 80 ºF.

The data collected from the office show the temperature nearly every every day reaching above 73ºF.
